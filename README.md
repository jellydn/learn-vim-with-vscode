## Setup

### VSCodeVim

VSCodeVim is a Vim emulator for Visual Studio Code.

1. Install the extension from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)
2. After installation, you can modify settings in your settings.json file to customize the Vim experience. An example configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim).

### VSCode-Neovim

VSCode-Neovim is an extension that integrates Neovim into Visual Studio Code for advanced Vim features.

1. Install Neovim on your system. The installation guide can be found [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim).
2. Install the VSCode-Neovim extension from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim)
3. After installation, specify the path to your Neovim executable in your settings.json file.
4. You can also customize keybindings in your keybindings.json file, and use a lua file for additional customization. Example configurations can be found [here](https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim).

## Usage

To begin using Vim commands in Visual Studio Code, just open a file and start editing. Remember that the modes (insert, normal, visual) are a key part of Vim, and if you're not familiar with them, you should look into a [Vim tutorial](https://www.openvim.com/).

## File Reference

The repository includes several configuration files that are needed to set up and customize VSCodeVim and VSCode-Neovim:

- [vim-settings.json](./vim-settings.json): Contains settings for the VSCodeVim extension. Copy its content to your VS Code `settings.json` file.
- [keybindings.json](./keybindings.json): Contains custom keybindings for the VSCode-Neovim extension. Copy its content to your VS Code `keybindings.json` file.
- [nvim-settings.json](./nvim-settings.json): Contains settings for the VSCode-Neovim extension. Copy its content to your VS Code `settings.json` file.
- [vs-code.lua](./vs-code.lua): Lua configuration file for Neovim when used with the VSCode-Neovim extension. You need to put this in your Neovim configuration directory.

Please make sure to adjust the file paths according to your system configuration and needs.
